# Animation fields
# - id:
#   The internal ID to use for registering the animation with SexLab.
#   This ID must match the animation file names in the
#   meshes/actors/.../animations directories.
#   For example, if the id is "MyCoolAnimation", the animation file names
#   should be MyCoolAnimation_A1_S1.hkx, MyCoolAnimation_A1_S2.hkx, etc.
#
# - name
#   The animation name that will be displayed to users in SexLab and MCM menus
#
# - tags
#   Tags defined for this animation.
#
# - sound
#   The sound effect to use for this animation:
#   Allowed values:
#   - Squishing
#   - Squirting
#   - Sucking
#   - SexMix
#   - NoSound
#
# - actor1, actor2, actor3, actor4, actor5
#   Actor definitions.  Possible values:
#   - Male, Female, CreatureMale, CreatureFemale
#
#   Female and CreatureFemale actors accept an add_cum argument describing what
#   cum settings should be applied for this animation.  Allowed add_cum values:
#   - Vaginal, Oral, Anal, VaginalOral, VaginalAnal, OralAnal, VaginalOralAnal
#
#   CreatureMale and CreatureFemale actors require a "race" argument specifying
#   the creature race.  Examples of valid races include Draugrs, Horses,
#   SabreCats, Trolls, etc.
#
#   Actor objects can also accept any stage parameter applicable to the
#   a1_stage_params arguments below.  Stage parameters specified in the actor
#   object will be applied to all of that actor's stages, unless overridden by
#   an specific stage parameter in aX_stage_params.
#
# - a1_stage_params, a2_stage_params, etc.
#
#   Parameters for specific stage animations for the specified actor.
#   For example, a1_stage_params=[Stage(2, silent=true)]
#   specifies that actor1 should be silent during stage 2.
#
#   If you want a setting to apply to all stages for an actor, you can also
#   pass the setting as an argument to the Actor object.  For instance,
#   Male(silent=True) will make that actor silent for all stages (except stages
#   that are explicitly overridden with a Stage parameter setting silent=False
#   again for that stage).
#
#   Stage parameters:
#   - forward : Move the actor forward by the specified amount
#   - side : Move the actor to the side by the specified amount
#   - up : Move the actor up by the specified amount
#   - rotate : Rotate the actor by the given number of degrees
#   - silent : True / False
#   - open_mouth : True / False
#   - sos : integer setting
