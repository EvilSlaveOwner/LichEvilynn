================================================

E-Head:
It looks like this is Saarthal. I can teleport closer. It to the south. I think.

E-Head:
It's around here somewhere...

E:
Hail the fire! It's freezing out here. Do you mind if I take a few minutes to warm up?

B:
I don’t have anything to share other than the fire, but your welcome to stay. 
Good company is always welcome. If you don’t mind satisfying my curiosity. 
Who are you? What are you doing out here? You don't look like a hunter.

E:
I'm Lynn, an adventurer. I just cleaned out the lair of an ancient ghost farther up this valley.

B:
That's exciting! I thought about becoming an adventurer, but I decided to do something safer. Leatherworking and hunting are my trades, though in these dangerous times I sometime think I may as well be an adventurer.

E:
There are awards to adventuring, both financial and spiritual.
You help make the world a better, safer place, and it also helps put a little jingle in your purse.
I already made one trip back to town to sell off what I found in the ghost’s lair, and now I'm heading back in.

B:
Heading back in? Why? 

E:
After killing a monster, you can find many things worth selling laying around. More than you can carry in one trip. 
So, after defeating them, you search for the most valuable gear, and you take it back to town and sell it. Then you head back for the next round.
It's often worth making two or even three trips. The profit on the second and third is much lower, but so is the risk.

B:
That's interesting. What did the ghost look like? What kind of treasure did you find?

E:
The ghost? She was some ancient mage. She hovered midair and you could see through her just like in all the ghost stories.
As for the treasure, I found quite a few pieces of jewelry, some silver candlesticks, and a few potions. I already sold them.
I there is more to sell, but none of is as nice as what I've already sold.
If you're interested, you could come with me. Save me from making that third trip. You can keep half of what you carry out.

B:
That sounds exciting. I'd love to come.

E:
Well, I've had a long day. Let’s to head out in the morning.

E-Head:
Of course, I'm interested in Sara. She has a beautiful body.
Should I wear you and fuck her, or wear her and fuck you?
I'm raping both of you at the same time either way...
I have a fun decision to make tomorrow.

So how did you find out about this ghost how did you know where to find her?

I was doing some research at the college and found an old spell Clinton opens a path to her lair. You probably walked past it several times without even seeing it. I'll show you when we get there.

It's not much farther. Do you see the engraving on the ground over there?  There's a spell that you cast on it that opens the way in.

Walk up and cast spell.. 

Wow! It wasn't visible! I couldn't tell it was there at all! Let's go in!

TP both inside....

-----

Next Quest...

The main room is up ahead. It has a strange device with crystals all over it. I'm going to let the college know about it. They will probably pay me a fortune for it!

Why are there so many jail cells? Whoever owned this place was either a jailer or a very evil person. I'm glad they're gone.

Cells start open..
Hunter looks in the cell (doesnt go through the door)
EL blasts hunter with a gust of wind from behind... And the cell door closes locking the hunter in.

What do you think you're doing! Let me out!

You know it's kind of funny. You're exactly right. I am a very evil person. I wasn't a jailer. These cells or for my toys.

Who are you!

EL leaves player, who is still unable to move or speak...

I'm Evelyn. Welcome to my home. You will spend the rest of your life here. Now I'm going to get to know you better.

EL invades hunter.. MB scene plays.

I think I'll name you xxx. That was fun, but more importantly you have a sister. And she's on her way to meet you. Don't worry I'll take good care of her. 

We have some time to kill and you and Dolly have a very important lesson to learn.

PPit for both.

First I'm going to watch the two of you fuck. Pretend to enjoy it.

Then I'll wear one of you, and rape the other.

Begin!

SL nice Scene.

EL posses hunter.

SL Rough scene

Fade to black...

Sister quest starts..
