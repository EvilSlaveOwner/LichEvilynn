E
Hold up! Never assume a place like this is safe.

B
*Cough* Oh, I didn't think of that. I wasn't expecting so much dust either. I should have. What do you want me to do?

E
I'll keep an eye out for danger, and you can search the rooms. I'll go in first, and if it looks clear, then you come in after me.

B
I'll be right behind you.

E
Move quietly, and stay alert.

E
Wait here.

B
Ok.
..... both sneak down the hall. After E enters the main room and looks around, she stops sneaking and motions B inside. ....

B
What do I do now?

E
Now you start searching for anything worth selling. I suggest you start by searching the corpse in that cell.

B
Searching Corpses, something else I didn't think about.

Wait prison cell? Why would a mage have a prison cell? Make that several prison cells! I can't think of any good reasons.

I was feeling a little guilty for grave robbing some long dead mage. Now I'm just glad I never met her.

.... B heads to the cell and looks in.

B
What corpse? I don't see anything in here.

... E blasts hunter with a gust of wind from behind... and the cell door closes locking the hunter in.

B
What happened! Was there a trap I missed?

E
Yes

B
Where is the trap? I don't see it!

E
Dolly was the trap.

B
WHAT! Let me out! I don't understand!

E
Dolly was the trap.

B
But, Your Dolly!

E
No, I'm just using Dolly. Like a puppet.

.. E appears next to the player

B
The ghost! *fear breathing*

E
I'm something much more dangerous than a ghost. I'm a lich.

B
What's... what's the difference?

E
Ghosts are the spirit of the dead with unfinished business. They are only slightly more powerful in death than they were before they died.

Liches are another matter entirely. A lich starts out as a powerful mage, and they gain in power after death.

B
Are you a good lich?

E
I'll answer that by explaining where liches come from.
Once in a rare while, a mage with great necromantic knowledge in the dark arts has the power required cast the extremely powerful magic required to extend their life past death.

Thus, the transformation into a lich begins. The lich fuels the process by eating souls that have been ripped from victims as painfully as possible.

The higher the pain and torment from her victims, the purer the ascent to Lichdom.

I achieved a nearly perfect ascent. My victims knew nothing but agony long before I started the process.

I'm very good at being a lich... but no, I'm not "good".

Unfortunately, transforming into a lich required breaking all my toys. It's time to restart my collection. First with Dolly, and now with you.

... E starts moving towards B 

B*Whimpering* This can't be happening. It must be a nightmare.

E invades B..

Scene 2
==================================

E
That took the edge off, for a little while anyway. Now it's time for me to explore your thoughts and memories.
... fear breathing / whimpering ...
E
A loving childhood is full of happy memories. Your happiest memory is of playing with your older sister, Selena.
You had trouble with her name, so you just called her Sissy. You and Sissy playing in the garden.
You wiggled your nose, she laughed, and that's how you got your nickname. Bunny.
Bunny is a cute name... I like it, that's what I'll call you from now on.
B
You can't change my name! My name is .... *gag sound*
E
Didn't you find Dolly's name strange? It's not exactly the name she was born with, but it's her name now.
Anyway, back to your memories. Sissy is very cute, and only a year older than you. That makes you, what, twenty? Sissy is twenty-one?.
Next time I leave here, I think I'll take her.
B
No, no, no, no, no...
E
You can't hide your thoughts or your memories from me. Where is she? In Solitude? Where does she live? ... Where does she work? ... I see.
Now it's time for me to keep two promises. I told Bunny I would give her a position under me, and I told Dolly that I would rape the two of you today.
I'm going to start by wearing one of you, and fucking the other.
Bunny, you decide what happens now. Who do I wear first? Bunny, or Dolly?

If you don't answer, I'm going to assume the answer is "Rape us both in the ass with a strap-on"
No?
B
Don't wear me!
E
You can do better than that. Say "Please", and refer to me as Mistress, and refer to yourself as Bunny.
B
*crying*
*quietly* Please don't wear me, Mistress.
E
Louder. I also said to refer to yourself as "Bunny"
B
Please don't wear Bunny, Mistress
E
Then act like my lover. We will make love, and when I orgasm, you better have one with me. This time you can have a fake it. But never fake an orgasm without permission.

...SL nice Scene (Generic)...

E
Now it's time to trade places. Dolly, I'm going to possess Bunny, put on a strap on, and rape you. It's going to be rough, and you are strong enough to stop her.

E
So it's Dolly's turn to decide. If Dolly resists, Dolly gets whipped, then we start over. I'll repeat as many times as necessary. 

SL Rough Scene (Generic)

Resist => Whip scene (make generic), then back to SL Rough Scene

E
*yawn*
I've had a wonderful day, but It's time to put the two of you up for the night. I'll see you in the morning.

Fade to black...
