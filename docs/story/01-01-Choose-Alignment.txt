	[MessageBox1]
		Your vision fogs and everything goes dark for you as you feel an immensely powerful entity invade your mind and body.
	[MessageBox2]
		You hear a voice in your mind, dripping with an evil you've never felt before.
	[Dialog1(Evilynn)]
		You are mine ... body, mind and now soul.
	[MessageBox3]
		For a moment that lasted an eternity, 
		you feel as though your very essence was torn from you and shredded into nothingness ...
	[Wait(2)]
	[MessageBox4]
		You feel everything fade,
		you no longer feel the comforting safety of your armour,
		the satisfying weight of your weapon,
		the flow of air through your nostrils,
		the taste of your own mouth.
	[MessageBox5]
		You are surprised at just how ... pleasurable dying is.
	[Wait(2)]	
	[MessageBox6]
		That same chillingly evil voice suddenly laughs with insane cruelty!!
	[Dialog2(Evilynn)]
		Oh no, I'm not through with you!
	[MessageBox7]
		You feel as though a thousand dragon's claws rip into your soul as you are dragged from pure bliss back into your body.
	[Dialog3(Evilynn)]
		I told you, you are mine, body, mind AND soul!
	[MessageBox8]
		You feel chilled to your very soul as you feel Evilynn caress your mind, insinuating herself into it like a poisonous, black fog.
	[Wait(2)]
	[MessageBox9]
		Slowly, you regain the sense of your own body...

		Your armour against your skin at first.
		Then the moistness of you mouth.
		The smell of a nearby torch.
		The sound of it returns.
		Finally the blackness lifts from your eyes!
	[DoFadeIn(0.0)]
	[MessageBox10]
		You feel your arms move, enjoying the feeling of having a body again.
	[MessageBox11]
		With dawning horror you realize that it is not your pleasure you feel, but hers.
		And, despite not understanding how you know, you know who she is.
		
		Evillynn
	[Wait(2)]
	[MessageBox12]
		Helplessly, your head is drawn down so that you can see down the length of your body watching your hands as they move of their will to slowly strip your armour from you
	[Dialog4(Evilynn)]
		Not their will, slave, mine.
		That's right, slave, I hear your every thought. I control your every muscle.
	[MessageBox13]
		Suddenly, you stop breathing.
		You just simply stop.
	[MessageBox14]
		Within a very short time, you can feel the need to for air. 
		You have the over-powering need to gasp for it, but nothing happens.
		You begin to black out.
	[DoFadeOut(0.0)]
	[MessageBox15]
		Suddenly you can breathe again, but it is with an unnatural calmness and not the gasping and gulping for precious air that would normally happen.
		Soon enough, though, your breathing was fully restored.
	[DoFadeIn(0.0)]
	[Dialog5(Evilynn)]
		Your fear is delicious.
		It's time for me to get to know my new body.
	[SexLab(Start)]
	[Dialog6(Evilynn)]
		I love the taste of your utter despair as you helplessly watch your hands caress and stroke your body.
		Can you feel my pleasure as I enjoy the feel of your body?
		Do you feel how much I enjoy forcing your hands to softly glide over your skin to softly, and gently stroke and cup your breasts?
		Your horror and despair are increasing my pleasure!
		What happens when I slide my hands down and part your lips?
		How does it feel when I stroke your clit?
		Will you have the orgasm with me? I think you will!
		How delicious! I can feel how humiliating this is for you.
	[SexLab(End)]
	[MessageBox16]
		With a feeling of shame and guilt you realize that you enjoyed the resulting orgasm.
	[Dialog7(Evilynn)]
		Mmmmm .... its been soooo long since I enjoyed my self that much.
		I am going to have so much fun breaking you like I broke the last one.
		She hardly lasted, but you? You are a LOT stronger. You're going to last a long time.
		Long enough to really take my time.
	[Wait(3)]
	[Dialog8(Evilynn)]
		But, I think I'll take a nap, let you run around a bit.
		Don't go away, slave, I'll be back soon enough and we can play some more.
	[MessageBox17]
		With another of her insanely cruel laughs, you feel her presence fade and control of your body returns to you.

[EVIL SCENE1]
	[MessageBox1]
		As you reach for a whip to begin enjoying yourself with the captive, you find yourself suddenly unable to move.
		A voice dripping with venomous cruelty that is both horrifying and enticing speaks in your mind ..
	[Dialog1(Evilynn)]
		Well, it has been a very, very long time since I have been surprised.
		Every other time, the girl has been freed.
		But not you.
		I find that to be a rather pleasing surprise.
	[Player Response1]
		What in Oblivion?!!? Who are you?! Get out of my mind!
	[Dialog2(Evilynn)]
		I am Evilynn and no, I won't leave.
		At least, not yet, I won't.
	[Player Response2]
		What is it you want? How do I get you out of my head?
	[Dialog3(Evilynn)]
		Its very simply, really.
		Centuries ago, I was able to modify a soul gem to protect my life essence, to keep it within instead of sending it on to the Soul Cairn.
		The process of transferring my essence to the gem depleted me, however,
		and it has taken a very long time to regain sufficient power to be able to begin to return to world.
		To complete my return, I need a new body.
	[Wait(2)]
	[Dialog4(Evilynn)]
		I had originally planned on just taking yours, but we seem to have similar tastes in ... hobbies.
		Perhaps you would be willing to help me?
		Help me to find a new body?
		It would, of course, require kidnapping suitable ... candidates.
	[EL_PlayerLastAlignmentChoice]
				
=========================================================================
=========================================================================

[Dialog5(Evilynn)]
	So, will you assist me or not?
		No, I'll never help you
			Well, that's too bad. We would have had so much fun together.
			But I don't see why I should do without just because you don't want to play.
				What the hell does that mean?!
					It means that I am taking yours!
					[GOTO GOOD SCENE]				
		Yes, That sounds fun
			Excellent! We are going to have soooo much fun together.
			[EVIL SCENE2]

[EVIL SCENE2]
	[MessageBox1]
		You can somehow feel Evillynn's cruel grin in your mind.
	[Dialog2(Evilynn)]
		I am unable to return to the gem, so you are stuck with me until we find a suitable body.
		But, not to worry, you'll hardly know I'm here.
		However, its a cruel world and I will protect myself from any betrayal you might think to try at some point in the future.
		I can see through your eyes, hear through your ears, speak through your mouth any time I desire.
		I can take complete control of your body any time I want.
		I shall now demonstrate ...
	[MessageBox2]
		You feel your arms begin to move and you realize that it is not you moving them.
		You can feel your head dip and you can now see down your body.
		You are unable to stop watching as your hands begin unbuckling and removing your armour and gear ...
	[Wait(2)]
	[MessageBox3]
		It doesn't take long before you have been stripped naked.
		You feel her enjoyment of the feel of your body as your hands softly glide over your skin as they move over your stomach to softly, gently stroke and cup your breasts.
		You cannot help but enjoy the sensations, becoming aroused yourself.
	[MessageBox4]
		You watch one hand move down you body to you pussy,
		feel your fingers gently part your lips
		feel one of them begin stroking your clit.
	[SexLab(Start)]
	[SexLab(End)]
	[MessageBox5]
		With very confusing and mixed feelings you realize that you enjoyed the orgasm as much as Evilynn did.
	[Dialog3(Evilynn)]
		Mmmmm .... its been soooo long since I enjoyed myself that much.
		And it looks like you enjoyed yourself as well.
		
		
		
[Final FG Segments]
		I do hope you understand the need for that little demonstration.
		And I assure you that I will not take control unless you make it necessary.
	[Player Response1]
		How do I know you won't do so anytime you want?
	[Dialog4(Evilynn)]
		Frankly, you don't.
		But, as long as our interests are aligned and you do not try to betray me, you have nothing to worry about.
		Furthermore, this is temporary arrangment.
		Once we find a new body for me, I will happily transfer to it.
	[Player Response2]
		How can I be sure of that?
	[Dialog5(Evilynn)]
		Because, over the centuries that I have been in that gem I have come to realize
		that if I had someone to help me I may not have had to resort to modifying the gem in the first place.
		So, it is to my own advantage to find a new body and then to invite you to join me in pursuit of our mutual ... interests.
	[Player Response3]
		Hmmmm .... 'mutual intersts', eh? Sounds like a like an interesting propostion.
	[Dialog6(Evilynn)]
		Excellent!
		Now, before we begin the search, we need a safe and discrete place to use as a base.
		I have the perfect place in mind.
	[Player Response4]
		Oh?
	[MessageBox6]
		You feel a feathery touch across your mind
	[MessageBox7]
		You suddenly realize that you now know the location of Evilynn's old lair.
	[Update Map]
	[Dialog7(Evilynn)]
		And now you have the perfect place in mind as well.
	[Player Response5]
		Well. Shall we go see how the old place has fared over all this time, partner?
	[Dialog8(Evilynn)]
		Oh, yes, partner! Let us be on our way.
	[MessageBox8]
		You hear Evilynn happily laugh, and her presence fades to the back of your mind.
